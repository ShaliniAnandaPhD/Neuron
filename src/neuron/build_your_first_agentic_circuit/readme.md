# Neuron Framework - Quick Start Implementation Guide

Welcome! This guide will help you build a working Neuron framework system from scratch. By the end, you'll have a functioning 3-agent neural circuit that can optimize Kotler flow states.

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Create Project Structure

First, create and run the setup script:

```bash
# Create setup_neuron.py with the setup script code (from artifacts above)
python setup_neuron.py
```

This creates the complete directory structure and installs dependencies.

### Step 2: Implement Core Files

Copy the code from the artifacts into these files in order:

#### 2.1 Core Base Classes
📁 **File**: `neuron/core/base.py`
📋 **Source**: Artifact "neuron/core/base.py - Core Base Classes"

This file contains:
- `Message` class for communication
- `BaseAgent` abstract class
- Memory interfaces
- Core enums and data structures

#### 2.2 Message Routing System  
📁 **File**: `neuron/core/messaging.py`
📋 **Source**: Artifact "neuron/core/messaging.py - SynapticBus Message Routing"

This file contains:
- `SynapticBus` for message routing
- Priority queues and routing strategies
- Fault tolerance and load balancing

#### 2.3 Working Memory System
📁 **File**: `neuron/memory/working.py`  
📋 **Source**: Artifact "neuron/memory/working.py - Working Memory Implementation"

This file contains:
- `WorkingMemory` class with LRU caching
- Automatic expiration and persistence
- Memory search and management

#### 2.4 Deliberative Agent
📁 **File**: `neuron/agents/deliberative_agent.py`
📋 **Source**: Artifact "neuron/agents/deliberative_agent.py - Deliberative Agent Implementation"

This file contains:
- `DeliberativeAgent` with reasoning capabilities
- Planning and goal management
- Multiple reasoning strategies

#### 2.5 Working Demo
📁 **File**: `examples/basic_circuit/simple_demo.py`
📋 **Source**: Artifact "examples/basic_circuit/simple_demo.py - Working Example"

This file contains:
- Complete 3-agent circuit demo
- Kotler flow optimization simulation
- Interactive and automated modes

### Step 3: Test Your Implementation

```bash
# Run basic tests
python run.py test

# Should show:
# ✅ test_message_creation PASSED
# ✅ test_agent_creation PASSED  
# ✅ test_synaptic_bus PASSED
```

### Step 4: Run the Demo

```bash
# Run the automated demo
python run.py demo
```

You should see output like:

```
🚀 Starting Neuron Framework Demo
============================================================

📋 Scenario 1/3
🎯 Processing scenario: Basic Flow Analysis
   User Profile: {'stress': 3, 'challenge': 7, 'skill': 5, 'focus': 6}
   Expected Flow: 0.65

   📊 Step 1: Flow Analysis
      ✅ Current flow calculated: 0.58
   🧠 Step 2: Memory Operations  
      ✅ Memory operations completed, context strength: 0.70
   🎯 Step 3: Optimization Decision
      ✅ Strategy: enhance_skills, Flow: 0.58 → 0.73

   ✅ Results for Basic Flow Analysis:
      Expected Flow: 0.65
      Final Flow:    0.73
      Improvement:   +0.15
      Messages:      3
      Strategy:      enhance_skills
```

### Step 5: Try Interactive Mode

```bash
# Run interactive demo
python run.py interactive
```

This lets you input your own stress, challenge, skill, and focus levels to see how the system optimizes them.

## 🧠 Understanding the Architecture

### The 3-Agent Circuit

1. **CognitiveDetector**: Analyzes user flow state using Kotler model
2. **MemoryController**: Stores and retrieves context and historical data  
3. **DecisionEngine**: Makes optimization decisions and creates intervention plans

### Message Flow

```
User Profile → CognitiveDetector → MemoryController → DecisionEngine → Results
```

Each agent:
- Receives structured JSON messages
- Processes using deliberative reasoning
- Stores results in working memory
- Sends responses back through SynapticBus

### Key Features Demonstrated

- **Real Agent Coordination**: Actual agents talking via structured messages
- **Memory Systems**: Working memory with LRU caching and persistence
- **Fault Tolerance**: Message routing with retries and error handling
- **Multiple Reasoning**: Logical, probabilistic, heuristic strategies
- **Complete Observability**: Full logging and performance metrics

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import Errors**: 
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root directory
cd /path/to/your/neuron-project
python run.py demo
```

**Missing Dependencies**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**File Not Found**:
- Ensure all 5 core files are created with the artifact code
- Check that file paths match exactly: `neuron/core/base.py` etc.

**Python Version**:
- Requires Python 3.8+
- Check with: `python --version`

### Debugging Mode

```bash
# Enable verbose logging
python examples/basic_circuit/simple_demo.py --verbose
```
