# 🧠 Neuron Core Framework (src/neuron)

This directory contains the core infrastructure of the **Neuron AI Framework** — including the agent engine, memory systems, routing logic, and observability stack.

Neuron is a proprietary modular architecture created by **Shalini Ananda, PhD**, designed for resilient reasoning, adaptive orchestration, and cognitive fault tolerance in real-world systems.
