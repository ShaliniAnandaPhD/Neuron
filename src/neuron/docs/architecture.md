# Neuron Architecture

## Overview

Neuron is a modular cognitive architecture designed for dynamic, multi-agent interactions with adaptive memory systems. It enables the composition of specialized AI agents into flexible circuits that can collectively solve complex problems while maintaining state, adapting to failures, and providing observability into execution paths.

The system is built around the concept of neural circuits - configurable pipelines of specialized agents that communicate via a central message bus and store information in various memory systems. This architecture enables both simple linear workflows and complex, adaptive processing with conditional branching, feedback loops, and dynamic routing.

## Core Principles

1. **Modularity**: Components are designed to be self-contained and interchangeable
2. **Adaptivity**: System can dynamically route information based on context and confidence
3. **Memory-centric**: Multiple memory systems provide different types of knowledge retention
4. **Observability**: Comprehensive tracing and monitoring of all system operations
5. **Resilience**: Graceful handling of errors and failures through fallback mechanisms
6. **Multimodal**: Seamless handling of different data types and modalities

## Development Guidelines

### Component Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component should have a clear, focused responsibility
2. **Interface Stability**: Public interfaces should remain stable even as implementations evolve
3. **Configurability**: Components should be configurable without code changes
4. **Testability**: Components should be designed for ease of testing
5. **Observability**: Components should provide visibility into their operation

### Error Handling Guidelines

1. **Fail Gracefully**: Components should degrade functionality rather than fail completely
2. **Detailed Reporting**: Error conditions should include context and specific details
3. **Recovery Options**: When possible, provide multiple recovery paths
4. **User Communication**: Error messages should be actionable and understandable

### Performance Considerations

1. **Lazy Evaluation**: Defer expensive operations until results are needed
2. **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data with appropriate invalidation
3. **Parallel Processing**: Use parallelism for independent operations
4. **Resource Limits**: Implement and respect resource limits for stability

## System Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Memory requirements vary based on configuration (min. 4GB recommended)
- Storage for memory persistence (varies based on usage)
- Optional GPU support for performance-critical operations

## Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation**: All external inputs are validated before processing
2. **Memory Isolation**: Memory systems enforce access controls
3. **Agent Sandboxing**: Agents run in restricted environments
4. **Audit Logging**: Security-relevant actions are logged for audit
