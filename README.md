# Neuron: A Composable Agent Framework Toolkit

Neuron is a comprehensive framework for building composable AI agent systems inspired by neuroscience principles. It provides tools for creating, deploying, and orchestrating networks of specialized AI agents that can communicate and collaborate to solve complex problems.

## What Neuron Is For

Neuron is designed for creating, deploying, and orchestrating networks of specialized AI agents that can communicate and collaborate to solve complex problems. It draws inspiration from how the human brain works, with different specialized regions cooperating through neural pathways.

## Key Features

- **Agent-Based Architecture**: Compose modular agents with specialized roles (retrieval, planning, synthesis, classification).
- **Dynamic Circuit Composition**: Construct adaptive circuits that re-route tasks based on confidence, ambiguity, or failure.
- **Memory-Driven Reasoning**: Leverage working, episodic, semantic, and procedural memory to guide decisions over time.
- **SynapticBus Communication**: Enable asynchronous, scoped message passing and shared agent context across tasks.
- **Simulation Planning**: Support lookahead reasoning via simulated agent rollouts before committing to a path.
- **Multimodal Token Fusion**: Integrate structured text, vision, and metadata into unified token streams for reasoning.
- **Behavior Arbitration**: Resolve conflicting agent outputs using confidence-weighted voting and fallback logic.
- **Scoped Memory Access**: Query memory selectively based on context relevance and decay thresholds.
- **Reliability-Aware Routing**: Prioritize agent pathways using performance history and trust scores.
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Trace execution paths, memory usage, confidence levels, and circuit timing via NeuroMonitor.
- **Extensible Microservices**: Deploy agents and subsystems (e.g. ambiguity resolution, constraint planning) as reusable services.
- **Developer-Friendly Config**: Define and modify circuits, thresholds, and agent policies with YAML templates.

core.circuit_designer.deploy_circuit(circuit_id)

# Send input to the circuit
core.circuit_designer.send_input(circuit_id, {"data": "Hello, world!"})
```

## Core Components

Neuron is comprised of several key components that work together to create a flexible and powerful agent framework:

### NeuronCore

The central coordinator for the framework, responsible for initializing and managing all components.

```python
from neuron import NeuronCore

# Get the singleton instance
core = NeuronCore()
```

### Agents

Specialized processing units that can receive and send messages, perform tasks, and learn from experience.

```python
# Create different types of agents
reflex_agent = create_agent(ReflexAgent)
deliberative_agent = create_agent(DeliberativeAgent)
learning_agent = create_agent(LearningAgent)
coordinator_agent = create_agent(CoordinatorAgent)
```

### Memory Systems

Different types of memory for storing and retrieving information.

```python
# Access different memory types
working_memory = core.memory_manager.get_memory_system(MemoryType.WORKING)
episodic_memory = core.memory_manager.get_memory_system(MemoryType.EPISODIC)
semantic_memory = core.memory_manager.get_memory_system(MemoryType.SEMANTIC)
```

### SynapticBus

Communication system that enables message exchange between agents.

```python
# Send a message
message = Message.create(
    sender="agent1",
    recipients=["agent2"],
    content={"data": "Hello"}
)
await core.synaptic_bus.send(message)
```

### CircuitDesigner

Tool for creating and managing networks of agents.

```python
# Create a circuit from a template
circuit_id = await core.circuit_designer.create_from_template(
    "sequential_pipeline",
    {
        "processor1_type": "DeliberativeAgent",
        "processor2_type": "LearningAgent"
    }
)
```

### Behavior Control

System for dynamically adjusting agent behavior.

```python
from neuron import BehaviorTrait, with_behavior_control

# Enhance an agent with behavior control
EnhancedAgent = with_behavior_control(ReflexAgent)
agent = EnhancedAgent()

# Adjust behavior traits
agent.get_behavior_controller().set_trait(BehaviorTrait.CURIOSITY, 0.8)
```

### Monitoring

System for tracking metrics and diagnosing issues.

```python
# Get system metrics
metrics = core.neuro_monitor.get_metrics("system.*")

# Check health status
health = core.neuro_monitor.get_health_status()
```

## Command-Line Interface

Neuron includes a command-line interface for managing the framework:

```bash
# Initialize the framework
neuron init

# Start the framework
neuron start

# View status
neuron status --detailed

# List available agent types
neuron agent list

# Create a circuit from a template
neuron circuit create sequential_pipeline --params '{"processor1_type": "DeliberativeAgent"}'
```

## Neuroscience Foundations

Neuron incorporates several principles from neuroscience:

- **Specialized Processing Regions**: Agents with specific capabilities, like brain regions.
- **Hierarchical Information Processing**: Circuit composition for progressive refinement.
- **Neuroplasticity**: Learning and adaptation from experience.
- **Working Memory and Attention**: Prioritization of information for processing.
- **Predictive Processing**: Anticipation of inputs and outcomes.

## Evaluation Metrics

To determine if Neuron is right for your use case, consider these metrics:

- **Task Complexity Analysis**: How complex are the problems you need to solve?
- **Emergent Intelligence Metrics**: Do you need system-level capabilities beyond individual agents?
- **Resource Efficiency**: How important are memory and CPU requirements?
- **Robustness and Reliability**: What level of fault tolerance do you need?
- **Development and Maintenance Metrics**: How much customization will you need?
- **Explainability and Control**: How important is understanding the system's decisions?

## Contextual Memory Architecture

Neuron implements a multi-layered contextual memory system that goes beyond simple token accumulation. Instead of relying on ever-larger context windows, we've designed a memory architecture that intelligently persists, evolves, and selectively recalls information.

### Core Memory Components

#### Layered Memory Structure
* **Working Memory** - Handles immediate context and current interaction state
* **Episodic Memory** - Stores sequential events and interaction history
* **Semantic Memory** - Maintains conceptual relationships and knowledge connections
* **Procedural Memory** - Retains action patterns and response strategies

#### Importance-Weighted Memory Decay
* Implements selective forgetting through importance scoring
* Weighs factors including recency, usage frequency, and explicit importance markers
* Preserves critical information while allowing trivial details to fade
* Adapts memory persistence based on contextual relevance

#### Semantic Compression
* Reduces raw conversations to conceptual summaries without losing essence
* Extracts core intents and key information points
* Preserves relationship patterns and preference structures
* Minimizes memory footprint while maintaining contextual integrity

#### Associative Retrieval
* Makes memory searchable rather than using all-or-nothing context windows
* Retrieves specific memories based on semantic relevance
* Implements context-aware search that understands references to past interactions
* Balances recency and relevance in memory retrieval

### Memory Persistence

* **Cross-Session Continuity** - Maintains relevant context between separate interactions
* **Memory Lifecycle Management** - Rules for creation, updating, and deprecation
* **Context Evolution** - Adapts memory representation as new information arrives

## Implementation Design Principles

* **Modular Architecture** - Memory components are separable and independently testable
* **Configurability** - Memory behavior is adjustable through configuration
* **Observability** - Comprehensive logging of memory operations for debugging
* **Efficiency** - Optimized for minimal computational overhead during retrieval
