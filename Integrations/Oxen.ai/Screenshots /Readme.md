   Summary statistics like mean, median, and distribution across features (age, thal, cp, etc.).

3. **Null & Invalid Detection Output**  
   Diagnostic report showing missing values in `ca` and `thal`, plus detection of `thal=0` as invalid.

4. **Outlier Detection (Age 167)**  
   Outlier warning on biologically implausible age entries, flagged by inspection logic.

5. **RedTeam CLI ‚Äì Corruption Triggered**  
   Execution of `neuron redteam`, simulating realistic clinical data drift and logical inconsistencies.

6. **RedTeam Output Summary**  
   Console printout summarizing number of corruptions per feature and type (categorical, numerical, logical).

7. **Corrupted Dataset Profile View**  
   Visual snapshot of the corrupted dataset‚Äôs structure and corrupted fields preview.

8. **Drift Detection: Feature Shift Summary**  
   Shows changes in mean, standard deviation, and entropy for features affected by red teaming.

9. **Corrupted Dataset Raw Sample Rows**  
   Table snippet including anomalous entries such as extremely low `chol` and malformed `thal` values.

10. **Schema Mismatch Report**  
   Report comparing original vs. corrupted schemas ‚Äî includes newly introduced nulls and encoding mismatches.

3. **Metric Comparison Table**  
   F1, Precision, Recall, and Accuracy before and after enhancement ‚Äî mapped to commit history.

4. **Oxen Web Dataset Card**  
   Public view of the dataset hosted on Oxen Hub, showing metadata and version history.

5. **Final Push Confirmation**  
   Screenshot confirming successful push and availability of the final dataset version.
