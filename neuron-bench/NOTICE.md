# ðŸ“£ NOTICE

**NeuronBench** is an open-source benchmark suite created and maintained by **Shalini Ananda, PhD**, as part of the larger **Neuron** project.

This benchmark is **not** a generic test script collection. It represents **original research and design** intended to stress-test AI systems under real-world conditions where failure carries real risk â€” healthcare, compliance, safety, and beyond.
