# 🧠 Neuron Micro-Audit Services
**What Breaks First → What Gets Fixed First**

Modular agents for failure detection and repair in complex, real-world AI pipelines.

---

##  Overview

AI systems don’t break because they lack logic —  
They break because they lose **context**, misread **intent**, collapse under **ambiguity**, or fail to track emotional dynamics over time.

**Neuron Micro-Audit Services** is a growing library of **self-contained diagnostic agents**, each designed to detect and repair a specific fragility pattern in LLM-based systems. These modules are plug-and-play, composable, and explainable.

##  Use Case Examples

| Micro-Audit | What It Detects | What It Fixes |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| `SarcasmAuditor` | Sarcasm misclassified as praise | Reclassifies tone using cultural + linguistic heuristics |
| `MultilingualContradictionChecker` | Translated terms that contradict intent | Resolves contradiction via primary language alignment |
| `UrgencyToneDisambiguator` | Polite masking in support requests | Escalates based on implied vs. explicit urgency |
| `ComplianceConflictResolver` | Conflicting regional requirements (e.g., GDPR vs. US BSA) | Applies jurisdictional overrides + audit trails |
| `BrokenThreadIntegrator` | Support threads with dropped context across platforms | Rebuilds continuity through identity + intent recovery |
| `LegacyParserAgent` | Invalid/mixed formatting in legacy systems (e.g., COBOL) | Normalizes inputs and validates hidden structure |

Each module is independently runnable and follows a consistent agent circuit flow.

##  Architecture

Each audit module is powered by the Neuron Framework’s circuit-based pipeline:

```text
[Input Stream] 
   → [Preprocessor] 
   → [Failure Signature Matcher] 
   → [Contextual Resolver] 
   → [Action or Alert]
```

All micro-audits:
- Operate independently or in composed chains
- Emit explainable failure logs
- Include confidence metrics and remediation traces
- Integrate with SynapticBus for shared memory and NeuroMonitor for observability

---

##  Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShaliniAnandaPhD/Neuron
cd Neuron/Microservices/ambiguity  # or switch to any other audit module
```

Run a microservice:

```bash
# CLI mode
python cli_resolver.py --query "Just wondering if someone could help me with my account issue."

# API mode
uvicorn api:app --reload
```

Evaluate against edge-case datasets:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

You can also compose audit pipelines:

```python
from micro_audits import SarcasmAuditor, MultilingualContradictionChecker

pipeline = [
    SarcasmAuditor(),
    MultilingualContradictionChecker(),
]

for agent in pipeline:
    input_data = agent.run(input_data)
```

---

##  Logging + Metrics

Each micro-audit agent emits:
- JSON logs to `logs/{agent_name}.{timestamp}.json`
- Per-stage confidence scores
- Before/after system behavior traces
- Optional red-team tags for future feedback loops

---

##  Why Microservices?

Because AI repair isn't monolithic — it's **patterned**.

Each failure needs:
- A dedicated listener
- A precise fixer
- A system that not only detects what broke — but also anticipates what might break next

**Neuron Micro-Audit Services** is our step toward context-aware, repairable AI.

for:
- Engineers building agent pipelines and LLM orchestration
- Researchers exploring cognitive repair, tone analysis, and regulatory conflicts
- Contributors who love debugging the edge cases static systems ignore
