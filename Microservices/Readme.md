 🧠 Neuron Micro-Audit Services  
**What Breaks First. What Gets Fixed First.**  
Modular agents for failure detection and repair in complex, real-world AI pipelines.

---

## ✨ Overview

AI systems don’t break because they lack logic —  
they break because they lose **context**, misread **intent**, collapse under **ambiguity**, or fail to track **emotional dynamics** over time.

**Neuron Micro-Audit Services** is a library of self-contained diagnostic agents designed to detect and repair **specific failure modes** in LLM-based systems. Each microservice isolates a single fragility pattern — like sarcasm misinterpretation, multilingual drift, regulatory contradiction, or data formatting loss — and handles it with modular clarity.

## 🔍 Use Case Examples

| Micro-Audit | What It Detects | What It Fixes |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| `SarcasmAuditor` | Sarcasm misclassified as praise | Reclassifies tone using cultural + linguistic heuristics |
| `MultilingualContradictionChecker` | Translated terms that contradict intent | Resolves contradiction via primary language alignment |
| `UrgencyToneDisambiguator` | Polite masking in support requests | Escalates based on implied vs. explicit urgency |
| `ComplianceConflictResolver` | Conflicting regional requirements (e.g., GDPR vs. US BSA) | Applies jurisdictional overrides + audit trails |
| `BrokenThreadIntegrator` | Support threads with dropped context across platforms | Rebuilds continuity through identity + intent recovery |
| `LegacyParserAgent` | Invalid/mixed formatting in legacy systems (e.g., COBOL data) | Normalizes inputs and validates hidden structure |

## 🧬 Architecture

Each audit module is powered by the **Neuron Framework’s modular circuit-based pipeline**, and follows a consistent processing flow:

```
[Input Stream] 
   → [Preprocessor] 
   → [Failure Signature Matcher] 
   → [Contextual Resolver] 
   → [Action or Alert]
```

All micro-audits:
- Operate **independently or in sequence**
- Emit **explainable failure logs**
- Include **confidence metrics** and remediation trace
- Integrate with `SynapticBus` for shared memory and `NeuroMonitor` for observability

---

## 💻 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShaliniAnandaPhD/Neuron
cd Neuron/micro_audits
python run_audit.py --module sarcasm_auditor --input examples/sentiment_issue.json
```

You can also compose custom audit pipelines:

```python
from micro_audits import SarcasmAuditor, MultilingualContradictionChecker

pipeline = [
    SarcasmAuditor(),
    MultilingualContradictionChecker(),
]

for agent in pipeline:
    input_data = agent.run(input_data)
```

---

## 📊 Logging + Metrics

Each audit agent emits:
- Detection logs (`logs/agent_name.timestamp.json`)
- Confidence scores per stage
- Breakdown of system response pre/post remediation
- Optional red team tagging for future dataset feedback

---

## 🌐 Why Microservices?

Because **AI repair isn't monolithic** — it’s patterned.

And each pattern needs:
- A dedicated listener  
- A precise fixer  
- A system that can detect not just what *was* broken — but what *will* break next if left unpatched.

Neuron Micro-Audit Services is a step toward **context-aware, repairable intelligence**.

## 🤝 Collaboration

If you're:
- Building agents that need **edge-case resilience**
- Working on **LLM orchestration or observability**
- Designing **safety or compliance-critical pipelines**

We’d love to collaborate.

## 🪐 Bonus: Try It Yourself — What Breaks First?

Let’s make this fun — here are two playful-but-real examples that challenge even the most advanced AI pipelines:

> 💬 *“Would I recommend this? Absolutely 🔥 … to people I hate.”*  
> *(Tone twist + emoji contradiction)*

> 💬 *“Diez de diez, pero el soporte es una vergüenza.”*  
> *(“Ten out of ten, but the support is a disgrace.” — multilingual sentiment trap)*

### 🎯 What to Watch For:
- Does your system catch the **sarcasm**?
- Does it understand **tone masking** or **regional expressions**?
- Does it adjust for **language drift**, **mixed formats**, or **emotional undertones**?

Run these through different architectures and watch how they interpret, fumble, or recover. It’s a great way to explore:

🧠 How modular agents reason differently  
📊 Where static systems fall short  
🔁 And what true **contextual repair** looks like in action
