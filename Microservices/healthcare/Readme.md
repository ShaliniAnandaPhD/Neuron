**Bridging Medical Silos: Unifying Multilingual Healthcare Records**

The `HealthcareIntegration` is a microservice in the Neuron framework that integrates and standardizes healthcare records across languages, measurement systems, and terminology differences.

## üîç Problem Statement

Healthcare data is frequently siloed across different providers, languages, and formats, making it difficult to gain a comprehensive view of a patient's health. This microservice specifically addresses:

- Language barriers in medical documentation
- Inconsistent measurement units (metric vs imperial)
- Varied terminology for the same medical concepts
- Detecting care gaps in fragmented records

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multilingual Processing:** Detects and normalizes content across languages
- **Measurement Standardization:** Converts units to consistent standards
- **Medical Terminology Resolution:** Links brand names to generics, connects related diagnoses
- **Health Data Synthesis:** Identifies conditions, treatments, and care gaps
- **Clinical Recommendations:** Suggests actions based on care gaps and best practices

## üß∞ Components

The microservice is composed of five primary agents:

### 1. MultilingualNLPComponent

Processes healthcare records in multiple languages:
- Detects document language (English, Spanish, etc.)
- Parses structured information based on detected language
- Extracts key medical data from different record types

### 2. MeasurementStandardization

Standardizes measurements across healthcare systems:
- Converts temperatures (F to C)
- Standardizes weights (lb to kg)
- Normalizes lab values (mg/dL to mmol/L)
- Validates measurement ranges

### 3. MedicalTerminologyResolver

Resolves varying medical terminology:
- Maps brand name medications to generic names
- Resolves diagnosis codes to standardized terms
- Identifies medication classes and potential duplications
- Links related medical concepts

### 4. HealthDataSynthesizer

Synthesizes comprehensive health picture:
- Identifies conditions from diagnoses and infers from other data
- Recognizes treatments from medications and procedures
- Detects care gaps based on conditions and missing treatments
- Generates clinical recommendations

### 5. OutputAgent

Formats and organizes the final output:
- Packages integration results with summary statistics
- Provides metadata on language and provider distribution
- Formats recommendations by priority

## üöÄ Pipeline Flow

The agents work in sequence to process and integrate healthcare data:

1. MultilingualNLPComponent analyzes and extracts data from records in different languages
2. MeasurementStandardization converts all values to consistent units
3. MedicalTerminologyResolver maps varying terms to standard concepts
4. HealthDataSynthesizer identifies conditions, treatments, gaps, and recommendations
5. OutputAgent formats and returns the final integration results

## üíª Usage

### Command Line

The `HealthcareIntegration` can be used directly from the command line:

```bash
python cli_integration.py --records patient_records.json --output results.json
